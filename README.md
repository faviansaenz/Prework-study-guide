# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for my project was to get a better understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. I built this project to cast what I've learned so far in the Prework and hopefully help bootcamp students who are going through the Prework. I sovled the problem of helping bootcamp students with this guide. So far i learned about the four main codes that i will using as I complete this course, HyperText Markup Language or HTML describes the structure of a webpage and tells the browser how to display the content. CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and describes how HTML elements should be displayed. JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Git is used collaborate on code and helps you keep trackof code changes.
